# XMAS_CLUE
Xmas clue script for Michael

Dear Michael,
Please run this script in a bash terminal. I'm not sure if it will work correctly with other shells or CMD.

The PATH variables may not be set appropriately on Mom's computer so plz specify the folder i.e.: ./run_me_plz.sh

Mom's computer does have Git Bash.
